# Development Principles

## Brief overview

This document describes the core development principles and conventions that must be followed when working on the project. These rules are designed to ensure high code quality, performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Performance Benchmarks

- All components must meet defined performance benchmarks:
  - Maximum response times for user interactions (sub-200ms for simple operations).
  - Efficient resource utilization (memory, CPU, network).
  - Scalability under expected load conditions.
  - Optimized algorithms and data structures for performance-critical paths.
- Performance requirements also include:
  - Regular performance profiling to identify bottlenecks.
  - Establishing baseline metrics for key operations.
  - Monitoring resource usage under various load conditions.
  - Implementation of caching strategies where appropriate.
  - Continuous performance testing in CI/CD pipeline.

## Quality Maintenance

- Quality must be maintained throughout the development lifecycle:
  - Automated quality checks on all commits.
  - Regular refactoring to maintain code health.
  - Continuous monitoring of performance metrics.
  - Regular security assessments and updates.

## OOP Principle (Object-Oriented Programming)

- All code must follow OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation to hide internal state and implementation details.
  - Inheritance to promote code reuse and create hierarchical relationships.
  - Polymorphism to allow objects of different types to be treated uniformly.
  - Abstraction to focus on behavior rather than implementation details.
- This ensures maintainable and scalable code design.

## SOLID Principles

- Classes, methods, functions and modules must follow the SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle (each class/module has one reason to change).
  - Open/Closed Principle (software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification).
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes).
  - Interface Segregation Principle (clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use).
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions).

## DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Code duplication must be eliminated and each piece of knowledge must have a single authoritative representation in the system.
- All shared functionality must be extracted into reusable components, functions, or modules to ensure a single source of truth and reduce maintenance overhead.

## KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Code and architectural solutions must maintain simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Before implementing complex solutions, evaluate if a simpler approach would be equally effective.
- Simple code is easier to understand, maintain, test, and debug.

## YAGNI Principle (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

- Only implement functionality that is currently needed, not anticipated future needs.
- Avoid adding features or infrastructure for potential future use cases that are not immediately required.
- This prevents code bloat and reduces maintenance burden.
